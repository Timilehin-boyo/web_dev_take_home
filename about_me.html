        <p>Semantic html basically adds meaning to the code and makes everything more organized.</p>
        <p>Headings provide a hierarchical structure for content, while sectioning elements group related content together, 
            creating a well-organized and semantic layout. </p>
        <p>attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are used to modify their behavior or appearance.</p>
        <p>text is added using tags like <p> for paragraphs and h1 to h6 for headings. You can style text with tags like
         b, i, u, and em to make it bold, italic, underlined, or emphasized. 
        Lists are made with ul for bullets and ol for numbers, and you can add line breaks with br or section dividers with
         hr</p>
        <p>HTML lists help organize items using either bullets or numbers. Use ul for unordered (bulleted) lists and ol 
        for ordered (numbered) lists, with each item inside an li tag.</p>
        <p>Links in HTML are created using the a tag, which stands for "anchor." You add the href attribute to set the destination URL</p>
        <p>Navigation in HTML is made using the nav tag, which groups links that help users move between pages or sections. 
            Inside nav, you usually place a tags (links) to create menus or navigation bars.</p>
        <p>Tables in HTML are created using the table tag to organize data into rows and columns. 
            Inside the table, use tr for rows, th for headers, and td for data cells.</p>
